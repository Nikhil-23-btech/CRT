**Dynamic Programming**:

Dynamic programming is an optimization based algorithm which is used to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping sub problems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant work.
 1. Overlapping sub problems
 2. Optimal sub structures
**Approaches:**
   1. Dynamic programming has two approaces they are:
     1. **Top dowm approcah(Memorizarion):** Writing the codes in recursiona and the solution of the sub problems are stored in array or hashmap
     2. **Bottom up approach(Tabulation):** We'll write the code in iterative manner and we fill tables(array) with solutions upto original problem.
